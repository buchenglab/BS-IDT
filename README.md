# BS-IDT
This is the github repository for the paper **Bond-selective intensity diffraction tomography**. This repository includes the codes and links to example data for implementing the BS-IDT method.  

**Abstract**

Recovering molecular information remains a grand challenge in the widely used holographic and computational imaging technologies. To address this challenge, we developed a computational mid-infrared photothermal microscope, termed Bond-selective Intensity Diffraction Tomography (BS-IDT). Based on a low-cost brightfield microscope with an add-on pulsed light source, BS-IDT recovers both infrared spectra and bond-selective 3D refractive index maps from intensity-only measurements. High-fidelity infrared fingerprint spectra extraction is validated. Volumetric chemical imaging of biological cells is demonstrated at a speed of ~20 seconds per volume, with a lateral and axial resolution of ~350 nm and ~1.1 µm, respectively. BS-IDT’s application potential is investigated by chemically quantifying lipids stored in cancer cells and volumetric chemical imaging on Caenorhabditis elegans with a large field of view (~100 µm x 100 µm).

**Requirements**

This code was implemented in Matlab 2020a. When operating in other matlab versions, please be advised that some aspects of this code may not function as expected.
